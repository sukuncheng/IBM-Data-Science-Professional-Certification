# Data Science Methodology - Final Assignment

### Apply the data science methodology to 'Emails'

### Play the role of the client as well as the data scientist to come up with a problem that is more specific but related to these topics.

- _As a client_.
  On a daily basis, we receive an average of around 30 emails per day. Except for a few important work and life messages, most of the emails come from commercial advertisements, promotions, social platform pushes and spam and scam emails. Dealing with jumbled emails every day takes a lot of energy. Sometimes important emails are also missed.

  The question is can the emails be organized according to the value of the content, and the emails with different contents can be classified and saved, and filter out the spam emails?
- _As a data scientist_.
  I would address the demand following the following stages discussed in the Data Science Methodology. Specifically,
  1. Analytic Approach:
  A classification model will be used to classify the emails, defining and sorting emails to different categories.

  2. Data Requirements:
  The classification model will be created based on multiple critera of email categories including the sender's email address, topic, language, format, have attachment or not, sending frequency, etc.

  3. Data Collection:
  To collect data, we will collect emails the client's various email inboxes (Gmail, outlook, yahoo etc.) together to create a comprehensive dataset. Presenting descriptive statistics and data visualizations of the dataset, we can identify the characteristics of the content .

  4. Data Understanding and Preparation:
  We should group emails by keywords in the emails, remove redundant data from the dataset, and fill in the correct information appropriately.

  5. Modeling and Evaluation:
  We create a classification model based on training subset from the collected dataset. We evaluate the goodness of the model according to the precision and accuracy. Based on feedback, we improve the model composition and parameters, iteratively, to achieve the desirable results.
